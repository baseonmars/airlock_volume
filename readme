Airlock Volume Control

Use these scripts with Airlock (http://themha.com/airlock/index.html?s=a) to dip the volume of your mac when you walk away and revert it when you return.

This is my first attempt at writing an applescript, i'm certain the way i'm saving between apps could be much better.

Installation

1. Copy both scripts to /Applications/Utilites

2. In the Airlock preference paine set the Action for when your iphone goes out of range to VolumeDip.app and to VolumeRevert.app for when you come back in range.
